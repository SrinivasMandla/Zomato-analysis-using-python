# Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis with Python

This repository contains a Python-based analysis of Zomato restaurant data, exploring various aspects of the restaurant industry, including cuisine trends, location analysis, rating distributions, and factors influencing restaurant success. The project utilizes libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization.

**Key Features & Analysis:**

* **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Demonstrates techniques for loading data from CSV or other formats, handling missing values, cleaning inconsistent data entries, and preparing the data for analysis.
* 
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explores key trends and patterns in the data through visualizations and summary statistics:
    * **Cuisine Analysis:** Identifies popular cuisines, their distribution, and trends across different locations.
    * **Location Analysis:** Examines the distribution of restaurants across different areas, identifies restaurant hubs, and analyzes the relationship between location and ratings/cost.
    * **Rating Analysis:** Explores the distribution of restaurant ratings, identifies factors influencing ratings, and analyzes the relationship between ratings and other variables (e.g., cuisine, cost).
    * **Cost Analysis:** Analyzes the distribution of restaurant costs, identifies factors influencing cost, and explores the relationship between cost and other variables (e.g., cuisine, location).
    * **Restaurant Type Analysis:** Explores the different types of restaurants (e.g., cafes, fine dining, casual dining) and their characteristics.
      
* **Data Visualization:** Employs Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations, including:
    * Bar charts for cuisine and location distributions.
    * Scatter plots for exploring relationships between variables (e.g., cost vs. rating).
    * Histograms for rating and cost distributions.
    * Box plots for comparing distributions across different groups.
    * Heatmaps for visualizing correlations.
      
* **Statistical Analysis (Optional):** Depending on the project's scope, may include statistical tests to validate findings and identify significant relationships between variables.
  
* **Insights and Recommendations:** Provides actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis, such as:
    * Identifying promising locations for new restaurants.
    * Understanding customer preferences and trends.
    * Optimizing pricing strategies.
    * Identifying areas for improvement in restaurant offerings.
